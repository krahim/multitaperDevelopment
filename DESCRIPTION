Description: This contains development tools for the multitaper package. This package is not yet on CRAN. If Fortran or C files are included then the Rtools will be required to build this package on Windows machines. I have not plans to put this package on CRAN, I will likely implement tools from this package in the main multitaper package after cleaning up and testing. PWLISPR is not available on CRAN.
